# 💬 Meterian Security FAQ (Playful Developer Edition)

---

## 🐢 It may slow down my IDE!

Developers like you built this tool, and they’re obsessed with performance. It only wakes up when your IDE opens, then goes quiet until you ask for a scan or change a manifest file (like `package.json`, `pom.xml`, etc).  
It’s like that colleague who only speaks when it really matters.

---

## 🌐 It may slow down my network!

Barely. It makes a few lightweight API calls: all lean, all cached, and typically done once per working session.  
A sprinkle of analytics calls too (one per analysis run), but nothing that’ll set your router on fire.

---

## 🧑‍💻 I’m already using `$tool-audit`!

Of course you are 😎 But if you ever forget, or just don’t want to bounce between the console and your IDE, we have your back.  
One click, zero fuss, instant insights.

---

## 🧪 The pipeline will tell me!

Sure, eventually 😏 But wouldn’t you rather know *before* you build weeks of code on a vulnerable or abandoned library (looking at you, [passport.js](https://www.meterian.io/components/nodejs/passport/))?  
With the help of this guy you catch issues early, when fixes are still cheap and painless!

---

## 🕵️ It doesn’t catch all vulnerabilities! `$tool` does a better job!

While that can happen, it’s rare, we use one of the [largest vulnerability databases on the planet](https://www.meterian.io/product/vulnerability-data-feed/#:~:text=of%20repackaged%20assets.-,Maximum%20Coverage). Keep in mind though, the **free version** doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the paid one. Well, at least until [this bad boy](https://github.com/MeterianHQ/vscode-extension-tracker/issues/2) is implemented!   
Oh, and we usually skip non-production packages, because we know you’re too smart to deploy those anyway 😉  


---

## 💬 It doesn’t support `$language` / `$tool`!

Easy fix: open an [public feature request](https://github.com/MeterianHQ/vscode-extension-tracker/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml&labels=feature,needs-triage&title=%5BFEAT%5D%20) and rally the votes (colleagues, family, your cat... They all count).  
The more noise, the faster it happens!

---

## 💸 It’s too expensive!

Mate… it’s literally **free**.  
Just hit [the marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=meterian.meterian-heidi) and install it already.

## 🔒 What about my privacy?

We don’t want your data, not even your email.  
We only see your IP briefly to guess your country (so we know which “hello” to imagine saying), and then we discard it.  
That’s it.
